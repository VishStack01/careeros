# Changelog

All notable changes to CareerOS. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-11-04

### Added
- **A product you can launch.** Free and Pro plans with Razorpay subscriptions (hosted checkout, verified and idempotent webhooks, cancel at the end of the cycle), operator grants for beta testers, and plan-based limits: matching every hour on Pro and daily on Free, AI actions per month, auto-apply per day and storage.
- **AI in the hosted app.** `/api/ai` runs dashboard AI actions on the service's model within the plan's monthly allowance, or on the user's own Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible or Gemini key, stored encrypted. OpenAI-compatible addresses are limited to known providers.
- **New design for the dashboard and the app**, matching the website: black sidebar on wide screens; on phones, a home with one big number and today's highlights as shapes, a floating dock with a pink "+" and an "Add..." sheet, and coloured detail screens.
- **Installable web app** (manifest, service worker, icons, an offline screen) and **Android and iOS apps** in `mobile/` (Capacitor), with a workflow that builds the Android app.
- Sign-in, pricing and policy pages (terms, privacy, refunds, contact) in the brand; pricing and app sections on the website; `docs/launch.md`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-11-04

### Added
- **Bring your own model.** `careeros/llm.py` calls Anthropic, OpenAI (and any OpenAI-compatible API through `OPENAI_BASE_URL`), Google Gemini or a local Ollama model with your own key, using only the standard library. Configure it in `.env`; `careeros llm` shows the provider and model (never the key) and `careeros llm test` checks it.
- **AI commands with code checks.** `careeros ai profile`, `careeros ai posting` and `careeros ai evaluate`. Values the resume doesn't contain are dropped and listed; requirements are kept only with a verbatim quote; evaluations must pass the same validator as `careeros eval-check`, with one retry.
- **Dashboard on your model.** When a key is configured, the local dashboard's AI actions run through `/api/ai`, which accepts only same-origin JSON requests.
- **Project website and docs** in `website/`, deployed to GitHub Pages with the job board at `jobs.html` and the dashboard demo at `demo/`.
- `pages.yml` workflow to publish the site on every change; security policy, code of conduct, issue and pull request templates.
